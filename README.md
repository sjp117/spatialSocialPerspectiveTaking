## Abstract (from thesis)

Perspective taking is a versatile ability that helps us examine both 
the spatial and social qualities of things. We take perspectives because it is 
adaptable to consider both the physical and abstract qualities of objects and 
people in relation to ourselves and other entities. However, it is not clear 
whether perspective taking in a spatial or a social context is performed using 
the same or different cognitive mechanisms. Two studies investigated the 
relationship between spatial and social perspective taking by measuring 
participantsâ€™ spatial and social perspective taking (mentalizing) abilities. 
Additionally, I administered a series of questionnaires that measured 
personality traits, visualization ability, spatial anxiety, and general anxiety 
symptoms, to investigate if there are common individual difference factors that 
contribute to both perspective taking abilities. I explored whether 
people who are good at taking spatial perspectives are also better at taking 
social perspectives. I found a positive relationship between spatial 
and social perspective taking ability, and that openness was a common 
personality trait that predicted better spatial and social perspective taking 
abilities. This suggests that both spatial and social concepts are represented 
and processed in similar ways, bridging our understanding of these two 
functions of cognition.
